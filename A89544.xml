            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF ever any Age needed a <hi>Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> this Lethargick one of ours certainly does; nothing but Thunderclaps, and Miraculous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being able to raiſe Mankind from their dead ſleep of Sin, and to rouſe than from their Carnal Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Impious Stupidity. 'Twas this lamentable Proſpect of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs of the Nation we live in that ſet me upon the following under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150001:4"/>
            <p>Never did any People commit ſuch Enormities, and ſeemed ſo inſenſible whether they had been guilty of them or no, as our <hi>Engliſh Vitioſoes</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: For if you tell the Prophane Wretch of his Swearing, tho the Oath i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſcarce out of his Mouth; yet you ſhall hear him avouch by an Oath or two more that he did not Swear. — If you tax another of being Drunk; <hi>Pſhaw, Pſhaw!</hi> crys the Brute, <hi>that's a ſmall Fault; pray who is free from the Piccadilloes of the Bottle?</hi> — If you charge a Third with Whoring; <hi>Who,</hi> replys the Laſcivious Spark, <hi>can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear indulging the inviting Motions of Fleſh and Blood? And what man but an Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite or Hermit can reſiſt the Impetuous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of his Youth?</hi> — If in the laſt place you adviſe any to be more Religiouſly Obſervant of the Lords-Day; <hi>Why, who</hi> (ſays the Licentious Libertine) <hi>has required this at our
<pb facs="tcp:150001:4"/> hands? Is it not enough to go twice a day to Church on the</hi> Sunday, <hi>but we muſt be Puritans and Phariſees at home too?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the true Account of the deſperate Caſe of our debauched Times; What remains, but that ſome one ſhould, tho I perhaps have not with Rigour and Menaces, with Thundrings and Lightnings enough, made them ſenſible of their Condition; leſt ſoothing themſelves up with the conceit of Gods Mercies, and Chriſt's meritorious Death and Satisfaction for their Sins, they remain ſtill in the Suburbs of Hell, and dance ſo long about the Pit of Deſtruction, till they irrecoverably fall into their Eternal Ruin? Do the Phyſitians uſe gentle Applications, and only ſtroke their Apoplectic Patients? No certainly, they find Rubbing and Chafing, Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Wounding, Scarrifying and
<pb facs="tcp:150001:5"/> Cupping little enough to make them recover of their Dead Fit. And ſhall the Soul in as deep an Apoplexy as ever the Body felt, have ſoft things ſaid to her? Shall the Obdurate Conſcience, and the Heart as hard as the nether Milſtone be ſoftly anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were with Oyl, and bound up as if nothing ailed them? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe Balſamicks would do better, when the Wound is laid open and ſearched throughly; when the Soul is touched to the quick, the Conſcience pricked with the Senſe of its own Guilt; and the Heart brought down to a Melting, Bleeding Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I am confident the Binding up the Sore before it be half Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and drawing a Skin over the unhealed Part is a ready way to cauſe a Grangreen. And I am as confident, that ſpeaking Peace to a People, when there is no Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb facs="tcp:150001:5"/> to them, and the gentle treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Vice is the great Cauſe of its ſpreading the Contagion, and of making the Infected inſenſible of the Plague, till ſuch time as it has got ſuch ſure footing, that a Cure without a Miracle is deſpaired of.</p>
            <p>And ſince things are in ſuch a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Caſe, what ſober man can forbear wiſhing that Impiety were reduced into ſome decree of Modeſty; and that Wickedneſs were but ſcared into Corners, that it may at leaſt from henceforth not dare to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the Light, and boaſt of its num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Eye of the World? And any rational man would be forward to think this might eaſily be done in a Country, where Chriſtianity is profeſſed in its Original Purity, and where the Fundamental Laws and Inſtitutions favour the Attempt. But
<pb facs="tcp:150001:6"/> alas! we find, tho we have Statutes to that purpoſe made to our hands, tho the Great Wheels have moved, and we might have expected the leſſer Orbs would have followed the Motion: yet moſt men ſtand ſtill, and thoſe, which do move, make but a very tardy motion by reaſon of the Oppoſition of a Major Party; whoſe Clamours are ſo great as to make the ſuppreſſing of Prophaneſs and Debauchery the Great Grievance of the Nation. So that tho there ſhould be a Scheme propoſed by the Beſt and Wiſeſt of the Nation for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the Deſign, tho there were more Laws made to back thoſe already in force; yet when that is done it would be to little Effect, unleſs there could be found Perſons of that Courage, Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Conduct and Prudence, as might accordingly put the ſame in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:150001:6"/> But where to meet ſuch as are Endowed with thoſe Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be the harder Task, if we conſider that we live at preſent in a World which never yet was ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as the Good made the Larger and the Riſing Party.</p>
            <p>As Reformed as this Age pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be, he knows very little of the World, that ſees not the great need this Corrupted Iſland has of a <hi>Speedy Reformation:</hi> A Work of ſo great a Conſequence, which not only Good Men ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but the Bad ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and all ought one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to promote. But what Rubs and Remora's, what Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and unexpected Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments has ſo Neceſſary a Work met with of late from ſome, who ſhould have been by the Obligation they lie under its forwardeſt Promoters
<pb facs="tcp:150001:7"/> and Encouragers? It would ſeem too reflecting to inſiſt hereon, and therefore I leave the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to conſider with themſelves whether they have acted like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or ſo much as like Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in doing what in them lies to hinder ſo Glorious a Deſign.</p>
            <p>That we are a People that do need a Reformation: That we are not ſuch white and undefiled Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we take our ſelves to be: That as long as we continue in thoſe Open and Crying Sins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which our Land at preſent groans, we cannot expect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of ſuch Mercies, as are already begun for us, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment and Fiery Indignation devouring us from the face of the Earth: That all our Pretences to Religion, and of our being of this or that Church
<pb facs="tcp:150001:7"/> ſignifie nothing without a Holy Life, and the keeping our ſelves Pure from the Corruptions of the Age: That thoſe, who are in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and involved in the Labyrinths of Sin, may extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves and come out of the Midſt of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and fly for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to a Spiritual <hi>Zoar,</hi> before the Deſtroying Angel overtake them with his Plagues; it is the Deſign of the following Diſcourſe to ſhew, To which end I have not ſpared to draw thoſe Vices I have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their proper, lively, and real Natural Colours: To lay the Plague, the Curſe and the Judgment at the Right Door: To call the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Intemperate, the Unclean Perſon and the Prophane by their Proper Names: And to tell them of the Miſeries, Calamities Wants, Diſeaſes and Death which are their
<pb facs="tcp:150001:8"/> Portion in this Life; and of the never-dying Worm, the never-ceaſing Pains, the never-ending Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the Eternal Unquenchable Flames, which (without God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon their Repentance) will be their Lot in another World.</p>
            <p>And truly I am ſo far from wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſevere word in the Enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe unwritten, that I am afraid of nothing ſo much, as that (being infected with the Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Prudentials</hi> of the Times) I have treated Vice too gently, and uſed the Vile Enormities too favourably. I could wiſh with all my Soul that every word therein were as ſharp as Arrows, and as keen as a two Edged Sword, that they might ſtab the Sins (I have treated on) to the very Heart; and bring the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſuch a Paſs, that they might be neceſſitated to flee to <hi>Jeſus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:150001:8"/> for the Soveraign Balſom of his Blood to heal their wounded Conſciences, and that being there they might ſee the neceſſity of living a Holy Life, leſt they ſet their own, as well as their Saviours Wounds a bleeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh.</p>
            <p>I have but one Word more to add; which is, to advertiſe the <hi>Reader,</hi> that I had an Intention of treating upon ſome other Malignant and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Vices; but perceiving that thereby I ſhould ſwell this Work to a larger Volumn, than I deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Manual ſhould be; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that, by advancing the Price above the Vulgar Reach, I ſhould rob the Inferiour Rank of People of the benefit thereof, and ſo loſe the very end of publiſhing it for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Good: I confin'd my ſelf to ſpeak only of thoſe ſins, which ſeemed to bear the moſt uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:150001:9"/> ſway in this our Iſland.

               <p>Man conſidered in his three ſtates, of Innocence, Nature, and Regeneration. A ſhort view of the Church from the Primitive to out Times: A ſurvey of the Degeneracy of the preſent Age; and the little Reaſon the open Debauchees have of ſtyling themſelves Church of <hi>England</hi> Men.

To him, did all the moving and creeping Animals of the Earth, the Winged Fowls of the Air, and the Sealy Fiſh of the Deep become moſt willing Tributaries: To Him, did the Firmaments above, thoſe Orbs of Light, the Sun, Moon, and Stars afford their milder Influence: To him, did all the Sweets of Paradiſe, and the Natural Product of the Fertile Earth yield Delight and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: To him, in a Word, was all the Creation ſo Obedient, as if Man were the only Maſter-piece of God and Nature, and thoſe other Created Beings but

               <hi>2.</hi> No ſooner did he fall and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs that one Commandment by eating the Forbidden Fruit, but the Scene of Glory quickly changed to that of Ignominy and Reproach: His Body became Diſtemper'd, Frail, and Miſerable; His Soul loſt the Divine Impreſs, and became filthy and abominable; His <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding was darkned; His Will Corrupted and Depraved; His Affections Vitiated and Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and his whole Man out of Frame. He had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Peace without, nor Peace within; but all in a ſtorm led an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nquiet, Diſatisfied, and diſcontented Life. All the Creatures now roſe up in Actual Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their transformed Lord, vindicating their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Honour upon one that had ſo ſhamefully abuſed it. And the laſhes of a Wounded Conſcience upon a ſenſe of his Guilt were more afflictive to him by far, then his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whipped out of Paradiſe ever was. What diſmal Effects his Poſterity met withall is apparent from God's Juſtice in giving them up to a reprobate ſenſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Iniquity with greedineſs, and then plaguing them with ſundry Diſeaſes, and divers kinds of Deaths. For from the very moment of the Fall the Intellectual became ſubject to the Senſitive Faculties; the Rational, nobler part of the Man was enſlaved to that ignoble part which he held in common with Brutes; and the Soul bowed down, and was conformable to all the Luſts and impetuous Paſſions of the Body.</p>

               <hi>3.</hi> In this languid condition lay the greateſt part of the Poſterity of fallen <hi>Adam</hi> for nigh four Thouſand Years. In the height of that Impiety, which proceeded from thoſe Corrupted Principles, was it that the old World was deſtroyed by a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Deluge of Waters: and the new One in its Nonage was diſperſed by a Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon of Languages at the Confuſion of <hi>Babel.</hi> Of all the Kindreds of the Earth, which then began to increaſe, did not God chuſe any, ſave faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, to place his Name among them. 'Twas <hi>Jacob</hi> was his Choſen, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Lot of his Inheritance; 'twas in the Tents of the Sanctified Tribes that the Glory of his Preſence ſhone; and by his Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted the Rudiments of a Typified Religion which hereafter was to be refin'd and confirmed by his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and Maſter, the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Sin of Profane Swearing conſidered from the Nature of a Lawful Oath: Blaſphemy, and Curſing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: The unaccountable Folly thereof, in that there is no Motive for it either in Atheiſm, Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or Reaſon; and in that we abhor it in thoſe we either Love or Honour. Four Pleas for this Sin conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and Refuted. The Force of Evil Cuſtom. Four Motives for the forſaking thereof. The Guilt of ſuch who, tho' they do not Swear themſelves, yet delight to hear Others Swear. Perjury Conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in order to Circumvent, or falſely Accuſe others: The difficulty of diſſuading Men therefrom. Motives to forſake it drawn from the Greatneſs both of the Sin and the Puniſhment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THAT all thoſe are Sins, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones too, none that have the leaſt notion of Good and Evill will or can deny. But, how abominable they are, will appear more by Conſidering, that all are the Profanation of that Sacred Name, by whom the whole family of Heaven and Earth is named. I ſhall conſider the three firſt together, for that 'tis rare to have the Man, who makes nothing of a Raſh Oath, to make Conſcience of Blaſpheming
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150001:16"/> God, or Curſing his Neighbour. How ſinful Profane Swearing is,<note place="margin">Firſt, The Sin of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Swearing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Lawful Oath</note> may be known by conſidering how Sacred and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn an Oath in its own Nature is: Being nothing leſs than</p>
               <p n="2">2. The calling and Atteſting the Ever-Bleſſed Trinity [the Searcher of all Hearts, the tryer of the very Reins, and from whom nothing is hid,] in ſome weighty Matter as a Witneſs of the Truth, and a Revenger of the Falſhood of what ſhall be aſſerted by the perſon thus adjuring. Beſides, the Divinity of an Oath (as I may ſo term it) will be more manifeſt by Conſidering, 1. That none are Admitted to take it but ſuch as are grown up to years of Diſcretion, excluding both the Mad and Perjur'd Perſon too. 2ly, That the matter thereof ſhould be grave, and not trivial or unlawful. 3ly, That the Form is moſt Solemn, ſuch as the lifting up of the hands among the Jews; the Laying the hand upon the Altar, as did the Civiliz'd Heathens, and upon the New Teſtament, as is uſual with us Engliſh Chriſtians. 4ly, That the end is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Truth, the deciding of Controverſies, the Manifeſtation of God's Glory, and the Good of Humane Societies. 5ly, That the Object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is only God the Lord <hi>Jehovah;</hi> the Omnipreſent, Omniſcient, and Omnipotent Being.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And is an Oath ſo Sacred in its own Nature? What a Folly and Madneſs as well as Sin is it then, upon every turn to call upon the Ever-Glorious Majeſty of Heaven to come and Witneſs our Trifles, Untruths, and oftimes Sins; as if we were willing to make him partake of our Impertinencies, Non-ſenſe, and Crimes? Would it not be a piece of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150001:16"/> Rudeneſs, Impudence, and Preſumption, think ye, to preſs into the Preſence of but an Earthly Prince, and bid him leave the weighty concerns of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to come and Witneſs your Idle, Frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Unneceſſary Diſcourſe? Yet ſo bold do Men make with the King of Kings, as to think him at leiſure ever and anon to give an Ear to the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that are made to him at every Table-Talk, Cheſs-Board, and Game at Loo.</p>
               <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">Secondly, Blaſphemy Conſidered.</note> Is the profane Invocation of God at every inconſiderate Trifle ſo great a Sin? How Monſtrous then muſt it needs be to fall ſoul un and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the <hi>Being, by whom we Live, Move and have our Being?</hi> True it is, Men muſt be arrived to a great degree of Impiety, that ſhall Curſe God to his very Face: Yet, tho' there may be but a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch as in direct Terms ſhall vilify their <hi>Creator, Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> God's Name may be Blaſphemed many other ways. He has his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, his Sanctuary, his Word, his Day, his Ordinances, and his Miniſters, all bearing that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <hi>[He that Honours you, Honours me: But he that deſpiſes you, deſpiſes me.]</hi> Theſe are the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Eyes, his ſenſible parts, whereby he may be wounded, tho' the Sin never reach his Inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſſence. And how frequent is it to have the Wretch in his Farce and Drolleries Romance upon the Sacred Scriptures? Buffoon the Holy Order? Speak ſlightingly and profanely of the Lord's Day? And make a mock at our Religious Aſſemblies? If this be not Blaſpheming God among the Gentiles, I know not what is: For this is all that the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter can or dare do againſt the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael:</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:150001:17"/> He can only ſtab him thus in Effigie, and would ſerve the Original no better did it lie in his Power and cannot forbear dethroning God in his Heart and ſaying, <hi>This Man ſhall no longer Reign over us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And can we expect that out of the ſame Mouth ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thirdly, Curſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</note> That he, who makes nothing of <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming</hi> his Neighbour, and himſelf? No, for certain, he that can do the firſt, never ſtops at a Conſcientious Scruple about the other: For what more common then to have the Bluſtering Hector, not only in his Paſſion to an Enemy, or a Stranger; but even in his ſober familiar Diſcourſe, wiſh the <hi>Pox,</hi> the <hi>Plague,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Damnation</hi> to his Friend or himſelf? And what is more amazing than to imprecate all this upon the Perſon he pretends to love extremely at the ſame time, as tho' he Curſed him out of pure kindneſs, and wiſhed him damned out of Civility? But what ſhall we conclude of thoſe Men, but that they are Mad and Frantick beyond the Cure of <hi>Hellebore?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But tho' every Place, and Corner of this our Iſle abound with ſuch profligate Wretches;<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naccountable folly of Swearing raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince it has no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement from Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, or Reaſon.</note> tho' this part of the World Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes with whole Volleys of Oaths and Curſing, which continually are diſcharged, as it were, againſt Heaven; yet did I never hear of one that could Alledge any thing like an Excuſe to extenuate the Extravagancie of their Guilt. Such an unaccountable Folly is there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150001:17"/> inherent in a Raſh Oath, that nothing can be ſaid as a Plea for the uſe of it; but Men Swear becauſe they will Swear. There is nothing of an Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either in <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Atheiſm</hi> or <hi>Irreligion,</hi> that can warrant the Commiſſion of ſo horrible a Crime.</p>
               <p n="7">7. An <hi>Oath</hi> in an <hi>Atheiſt</hi>'s Mouth is Nonſenſe and Contradiction. For by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking a <hi>Being</hi> by him diſowned,<note place="margin">1 No Motive for the Swearer in Atheiſm.</note> he manifeſtly gives himſelf the Lye; He thereby argues the weakneſs of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtabs his own Notion to the very Heart. For who can believe he is throughly perſwaded that there is no God, when at every Sentence he ſpeaks, he Mutters out the very Name? O that he denies a Saviour, when ever and anon he uſes <hi>Wounds and Blood</hi> to make his Diſcourſe Emphatical! Or that he thinks there is no Hell, or Devils, when in every turn of Paſſion, he calls upon the one to take his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Creatures; and heartily wiſhes them in the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the other?

                  </gap>mſelf, overthrows his own Principles, and demonſtrates the impoſſibility of being thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paced in ſuch Opinions. If he would uphold <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme,</hi> he ſhould refrain from taking that Sacred Name into his Mouth (the bare mention whereof is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient againſt him) and he ſhould invoke his <hi>Almighty Chance;</hi> and Swear by thoſe <hi>All power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Atoms,</hi> which by their own Magnetick Force, jumbled themſelves out of a Chaos into this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Globe; and he ſhould adjure thoſe <hi>Empty No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,</hi> to which he imagines all material Beings will at laſt be reduced.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:150001:18"/>
               <p n="8">8. Nor is there any thing of reaſon in a profane Oath. Thoſe Arguments the Devil makes uſe of to work upon a rational Man,<note place="margin">2. Nothing in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to induce the Sin.</note> and to induce him to Sin, are in this quite laid aſide. Pleaſure, Profit, and Fear, the common Byaſſes of the Will, and Corrupters of the Underſtanding, there are none to be pleaded as a Temptation in this Sin, as it may in others. Here the Devil has a cheap Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and Men ſell their Heaven for Nothing, and their Souls they barter away, and take no Money for them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But farther yet, the unreaſonableneſs of this Vice appears in that, how fond ſoever we are of it our ſelves, and are affronted when any Body reprove us for it;<note place="margin">The folly of this Sin, farther illuſtrated in that we love it not in thoſe whom we love or eſteem.</note> yet, tho' we love the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we hate the Traitors, and abhor a raſh Oath in thoſe we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Love or Honour. If a <hi>Wife,</hi> a <hi>Child,</hi> a near <hi>Relation,</hi> or but a <hi>Servant</hi> (whom we have a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for) Swear in our Preſence, how apt are we to check, and rebuke them? But ſhould a <hi>Judge,</hi> a <hi>Biſhop</hi> or a <hi>Prince</hi> Curſe and Blaſpheme in our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, How would our Blood riſe? And how unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ungenerous, and intolerable would it ſeem in them? And is not the offence as unbecoming us, and as notorious, as if the beſt Friend or worthieſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of them all were guilty thereof? It remains then that we charge the prevalency of this Sin to <hi>Cuſtom.</hi>

Can any Man of Senſe think, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of one unlawful Act can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the falling into another?<note place="margin">The Firſt Plea Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> Yet ſo abſurd is he that imagines the being carried beyond his Reaſon, will any thing at all leſſen the Fault of tranſgreſſing his Duty.

For is it not enough <hi>(Vile Criminal!)</hi> to incenſe thy God by falling into an unallowable Paſſion, and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Fury, but thou muſt at the ſame time provoke him yet more, by taking his moſt holy Name into thy profane, and unclean Lips? Thou hadſt no Warrant for thy mad Frenzie (let the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto be never ſo ſtrong) ſo as to forget thy ſelf, much leſs not to remember him, whoſe Wounds thou ſetteſt to bleed afreſh by thy piercing Oaths, and abominable Curſings. Whatever thou mayſt imagine, yet the being guilty of one Sin, will not in the leaſt alleviate the Commiſſion of another, tho' the latter be occaſioned by the former; but as thy Guilt, ſo will thy Condemnation, and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be double too.</p>
               <p n="12">12.<note place="margin">The Second Plea Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> And no better a Refuge will the next Excuſe be to the common Swearer. For will any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150001:19"/> Man believe him the more for his dreadful Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations? No, certainly this is a way of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Belief ſo praepoſterous, that it is the ready road to raiſe up Diffidence, where there was none before. If thou art Honeſt, and reputed a Man of thy Word, none will deſire thy Oath for a ſmall matter, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may do in a weighty concern: But if thou art known to be falſe or untrue, all thy Imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Execrations will avail thee nothing; for Men will think (as we ſay) their own Thoughts. A <hi>Liar</hi> and <hi>Swearer</hi> are ſo near a kin, having one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father of them both, that whoever has a Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has (Ten to One) a Lying Vein too.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Then as to the next thing, which Men uſe to extenuate the guilt of raſh Oaths withal.<note place="margin">The Third Plea Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> Ask ſome, (I bluſh to ſay) of even the better rank of Men, why, they vent many almoſt in one breath? And they'll tell you, <hi>it ſets off their Speech with a boon Grace, and adorns their periods with a lovely Decorum.</hi> A ſtrange and unheard-of Art of Rhetorick this! An Eloquence not much known in former Ages! That Oaths ſhould be ſo Elegant, that Curſings ſhould be ſo Emphatical; and all Diſcourſes inſipid and flat, that are not ſtuffed with them, is ſuch a new Notion, as makes me call it <hi>The Start-up Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om of the Engliſh Tongue.</hi> I know not how this blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Bombaſt ſounds in ſome Ears, but ſo far is this diſagreeing Harmony from affecting any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Man, that he would (I preſume) prefer the Croaking of Toads, the Hollowing of Owls, and the Cries of Ravens far before it. And I am apt to believe <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Panegyricks, and <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums have more Oratorical ſtrokes in them, than the Harangues of our Modern <hi>Vitioſoes,</hi> with all their

Let thoſe Oaths be never ſo graceful in the ſpeaking, yet I am of opinion, that were they penned down ſo that the Speaker himſelf might ſee them, tho' he might not bluſh at the ſight of his Sin, yet he would, no doubt, at that of his folly, in uttering ſuch unaccountably bombaſtical Nonſenſe. And as taking as it is with moſt, we never heard of any that recommended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or his Friend, to the Favour of any <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Potentate</hi> by <hi>an Addreſs of Oaths.</hi> Neither did we ever hear of any Council, in a Trial at Bar, that ever carried the Cauſe by <hi>Swearing to the purpoſe.</hi> Whatever the Lawyer may do in his Chambers, yet at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> he has the Manners, or at leaſt the Prudence to bridle his Tongue from thoſe exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Expreſſions.

               <p n="15">15. And are not theſe excuſes for the perſevering in ſo horrid a Sin empty, idle, vain, and inſipid?

In that Priſon, that Dungeon of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery, he has a full view of the Black Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar of Criminals, and ſees the Catalogue of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences (of which <hi>Profane Swearing and Curſing, Blaſphemy and Perjury</hi> are not the Laſt nor leaſt) not with Repenting, but eternally deſpairing Eyes.</p>
               <p n="32">32. And are not theſe thoughts terrible enough in all Conſcience to melt down the moſt Adamantine Heart? Can it be imagined that men are ſo flinty and Obdurate, as that neither a Senſe of their Guilt, nor an Eſteem they may have for their Reputation, nor the fear of Human puniſhments, much more of <hi>God</hi>'s Temporal and Eternal Judgments can win upon them to repent of their Evil ways?

But now all Vices in general, as well as <hi>that</hi> in particular, have loſt their former Modeſty; and nothing more Common then to hear the Wretch glory in his ſhame: as if it were a piece of his Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs to be mighty to Drink Wine, and of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong Drink. How incredibly this notable Trade of high-Drinking has been improved within theſe few years, ſince the Importation of Wines
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150001:29"/> and Other Foreign Liquors has been the Staple Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of the Nation; is too apparent. Old King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s temperate wooden Cups and moderating Pins that were ſtuck into them for marks,<note place="margin">Sp. Chron.</note> are now quite forgotten, and now there muſt be no limitation, no reſtraint in a Bumper. It has been (I am glad there is little reaſon to ſay it is now) a neceſſary Adjunct for a Loyaliſt to be a great Drinker; Carouſing and taking off full Glaſſes, giving great ſupplies to that ſpungy Branch of the Royal Revenue of Excize; the which is heartily to be wiſhed were exchanged for a more Honourable Subſidy: and eſpecially, ſince the main Objection againſt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſuch Beaſtly Immoralities is ſo prevalent upon that account.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

There are ſo many tricks and evaſions uſed by the Offenders, to wipe off ſuch a ſcandalous diſreputation from them, that unleſs we can meet with Inſtances of Dead Drunk Sots, they will make us believe that we fall ſhort of convicting any perſon of the Offence. Tho' of late days there are not wanting too many Inſtances of this kind, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more common than to find the Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raecan at the <hi>Devil,</hi> drowning his Cares for the World, as well as his concern for Eternal Welfare in ſome plentiful and luxurious Debauch; and having ſetled his Brains with the intoxcating Glaſs to ſee him in

               <p n="4">4. Upon the account of Mens different Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (ſome being more able to bear a Gallon than others are a Quart) and the different occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſame Man at one time more than another,<note place="margin">Wherein the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſts.</note> and the like, ariſes the difficulty of preſcribing ſuch and ſuch a quantity of Drink, beyond which is exceſs. But thus have moſt declared, that to drink more than to ſatisfie our Thirſt (of which our Nature, not our Appetite ſhould be Judge): To exceed the bounds of exhilaration and cheating up the fainting Spirits when occaſion requires either: and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the end, for which this action of Drinking was firſt ordained, <hi>viz.</hi> The preſervation of Health, is ſuch a degree of Intemperance, as falls under the notion of a Sin; and which muſt be ſeriouſly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. And the reaſon that the leaſt degree of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mmoderate Drinking is a crime, is (I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) becauſe of the Prolifick Nature of the Sin, which is too apt, having fled out paſt the <hi>Barriers</hi> of Moderation not to ſtop there, but headlong to be carried on to the very worſt Extremes. There are, as I may ſo ſay, ſuch ſecret Inchantments in the bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine, that when <hi>Circes</hi> has got but the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of giving Man a Taſte; tho' at firſt he may ſuck in the Philtrated Potion with caution, yet he cannot forbear returning ſo often to the Trough, till at laſt he is transformed into as natural a Swine as any Hog of them all, and can tumble in his Mire with the ſame delight as others of the ſame ſpecies, and waſh himſelf with the reſt, and return with them to wallow again.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:150001:30"/>

So likewiſe there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of thoſe mad Drunkards; and he who throws the Glaſſes over his Head, daſhes the Bottles in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and pays for thoſe his Extravagancies, is more excuſable, than thoſe who in their Frolicks break Windows, Bilk Coaches, Fight the Watch, and fall foul upon all they meet; Nor are theſe laſt ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous as thoſe who proceed to Murder, Rape and Incontinence: Nor are they again (tho' arrived to the higheſt Branch of Wickedneſs) ſo bad as that Inhumane, Unnatural, and Unparalell'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who to gratifie the Devil for ſome piece or ſervice done, was in complaiſance to the Infernal Deſire over-taken with Drink, and in that Brutal condition Murdered his Father, and committed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt upon his Mother, the very Thoughts whereof he in his ſober Fit rejected, abhorred and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>

And hence it is that we ſee ſo many Obſcene, and Offenſive Brats of Poetry ever and anon peep out into the World; which in former days would never have born the light. But theſe vile Dithyrambicks, the Product of Inebriated Brains are fitter to be Dedicated to <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Bacchus,</hi> or any other Bawdy Drunken Deity, then to be offered at the ſhrine of the more Chaſt and Temperate <hi>Apollo.</hi> It ſeems very unreaſonable to think that Intemperance which dulls and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tares ſhould quicken &amp; inſpire the Fancy; that what too often clouds, ſhould inlighten the Underſtanding; that the very thing which drowns ſhould heighten our Conceptions.

'Tis too true, this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of managing buſineſs in Publick Houſes, is what the <hi>Evil one</hi> has very ſubtily inſinuated as a means to carry on his own deſigns; and this is the method Men take now a days to increaſe their Trade and gain Cuſtomers. But let me tell them (under the Role) 'tis a Knaviſh, ſly and ignoble way of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing. If a Glaſs or two were all, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, there were little harm done: but when they are in for it, they ſeldom come off without a ſound Wetting.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150001:34"/> Wits they know he would not have been impoſed upon ſo, but 'tis no hard matter to cheat him to his Face when his Senſes are Sophiſticated and Loſt. So in like manner as to the <hi>Law,</hi> 'tis a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (I ſhould think were it not ſo Cuſtomary) for a Man to gain Practiſe by being a great Drinker; I know not what his addle Brains might do in winning upon Coxcombs of the ſame Kidney, but I believe a Conſiderative Man would be far from making him of his <hi>Councell,</hi> leſt the ſight of the <hi>Brief</hi> the next Morning might confound his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlepate, which was ſo deeply Souſed in <hi>Claret</hi> or <hi>Nottingham</hi> the foregoing Night; and make his gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Head run Counter in the Cauſe, rather then ſpeak any whit to the purpoſe.

The Life of a Soldier is in his Mornings draught: Who is able to endure the hard Marches, wet Trenches, and the continual Fatigues of a Campaign, that is not well warmed within? What Man of a thouſand would ſtand out a Field Battle who had not drank largely before? For none fight ſtouter and ſtand longer the brunt of the Battle then the half-drunk <hi>Cavalier.</hi>

Hence we perceive the mad Diſorders and Miſmana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements even of moſt diſciplin'd Armies in an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commonly to ariſe, which perhaps at a general Rendezvous were as well ranged as the beſt; but Drunkenneſs being the Preparative to the Battle
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150001:35"/> put all out of Frame, makes the Soldier giddy and hot, ſpurs him to raſh and mad Attempts, and engages his Intoxicated Headpiece in ſuch dangers, which none but his Hair-brain'd ſelf would run into. In this Confuſion Right and Left are both alike; <hi>to your Leader,</hi> and all ſuch uſeful words of Command are of no Effect; and helter skelter every Man is his own Officer.

They'll put all to the Sword, deflour Virgins, abuſe Widows, depopulate Cities, and burn down Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the Officers Charge is no more regarded after, than it was before the Victory.

Therefore I ſhall confine my ſelf to mention the principal places in Holy Writ, which ſeem chiefly to level at the Intemperate. The firſt which I ſhall mention, is, what the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> doth imply in that paſſionate expoſtulation he makes [<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.29.] <hi>Who hath Woe? Who hath Sorrow? Who hath Redneſs of Eyes? Who hath Contentions? Who hath Wounds without Cauſe?</hi> He tells you in the next Verſe; <hi>they that tar—
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150001:39"/> ry long at the Wine, they that go to ſeek mixed Wine.</hi> Here you ſee a large accumulation of Miſeries, Grief, Strifes, Violence and Wrong, which follow the Drunkard at the very heels: For the Wine may look delicately, ſparkle finely, and <hi>move it ſelf aright in the Glaſs, but at the laſt it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder.</hi> The next Woe we find is, that which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> denounces in theſe plain terms [<hi>Chap.</hi> 5, 11.12.] <hi>Woe to them that riſe up early in the Morning, that they may follow ſtrong Drink, that continue until night, till Wine enflame them, and the Harp and the Viol, the Tabret and Pipe are in their Feaſts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, nor conſider the operation of his hands.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Woe</hi> to thoſe Greedy, Luſty Drinkers, who to prevent the want of time, wherein to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate their Luſt, riſe early with the Morning Sun, and ſuck their Wine like the Morning Dew: Who are not contented when a Temptation offers, to embrace it, but ſeek out for one, go about from this Companion to that: Woe to thoſe who ſit whole days in Tipling-houſes, and protract their Clubs till after night: Who ſit up 2 or 3 Nights together, and (as the Vulgar have it) Sing Old Roſe, and go to Supper twice, Rant and Carouſe, Damn and Drink all in a breath: A Health to this, and a Confuſion to that Man and all his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; who in the midſt of all their jollity forget the <hi>God</hi> of Moderation, and with <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> praiſe their gods of Gold and Silver, of Luxury and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Who conſider not the <hi>Lord,</hi> nor regard the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his hands; How he often is unſeen at theſe Banquets, and will call them to an account, and put a Cup of Trembling and Aſtoniſhment in their

Theſe things are little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but 'tis the <hi>Lord</hi> that doth this, and they are (let men obſerve them or no) the Wonderful <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his hands.</hi> The ſame Prophet denounces a Woe in the ſame Chapter, [<hi>Verſ.</hi> 22.] in Words very near the former. <hi>Woe to them that are mighty to drink Wine, and Men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong Drink:</hi> Which ſeems to intimate thus much; that let Men be never ſo well able to bear ſtrong Drink, and have Conſtitutions as ſtrong as the Oak, and Heads as hard as Braſs; be they never ſo ſound of Body, and capable to ſwill down as many Gallons as their Companions can do Pints, and neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their Healths, nor drown their Memory, nor weaken their Underſtanding, yet notwithſtanding all this, there doth a Woe belong to them, and a Dreadful one too: and that becauſe they make uſe of this their ſtrength to the weakning their Brother, and the Drinking him down, as they are pleaſe to call it.</p>

If you have been hitherto carried away with your Carnal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites to obey them in fulfilling the Luſt thereof, be ſo no more.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150001:43"/> (which no Man knows how ſoon he may) he would have a large Field of Tares to cut down, and a plentiful crop of Uncleanneſs to employ his Sickle. We can cry out againſt the tolerated <hi>Stews</hi> of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and the Tributary <hi>Whores</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> We can rail againſt the <hi>Laſciviouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and wonder at the notorious <hi>Courtezans</hi> of <hi>Paris:</hi> But did we look <hi>Home,</hi> we ſhould ſee cauſe of greater Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and our very Streets could give Parallel, if not tranſcending Inſtances of Impudence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, which out-face the Light, and out-dare both <hi>God</hi>'s and <hi>Humane</hi> Laws. Formerly All (even Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) Acts of Impurity were condemned, and the name of <hi>Whoremaſter</hi> was the worſt Reproach that could be affixed on any Man: But now (oh Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy!) the Brand is an Enſign of Honour, and if you would Compliment or Flatter the Spark, you can do it in no properer a phraſe, than by calling him a compleat <hi>Beau</hi> and Gallant of the Town.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So generally ſpreading is this Vice, that it cannot but make any ſober Man's Heart to bleed that conſiders it: But as General as it is, ſo few are the Judgments of <hi>God</hi> upon the immediate Acts of this Sin, that we cannot but be filled with Wonder and Amazement, at the long-ſuffering Patience, of that Immaculate undefiled Being. But vile wretches that they are, the very Motive for their forſaking do they make the chiefeſt Reaſon for their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in this Sin: And the forbearing Mercy of <hi>God,</hi> which ſhould lead them to, keeps them off from Repentance. A ſad Thought this, that Men ſhould perſiſt in affronting and ſinning againſt <hi>God,</hi> purely becauſe he is merciful, but every Day and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150001:43"/> Hours experience witneſſeth the truth hereof, and renders it without Diſpute.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I had here deſigned to have inlarged upon the many <hi>pollutions</hi> of the Age, we now live in; but I foreſee that many miſchiefs may ariſe by too cloſely and pertinently handling this ſubject. It is ſuch a Sin, that to ſpeak againſt it in proper terms is by conſequence to defend it; and to explain the <hi>Nature</hi> of it in its proper Characters, will require the making uſe of ſuch Expreſſions as may ſully the Reputation of a Modeſt diſcourſe, offend a pure and clean heart, and perhaps be a means of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Vice, even while it is declaim'd againſt. This is no <hi>Paradox</hi> in times wherein all Advice and Counſel to reform the <hi>Impure</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean</hi> is too often thrown away. For there are not wanting ſuch Monſters in the World as <hi>wreſt the very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own deſtruction,</hi> and make the Sacred Oracles of <hi>God</hi> to preach up, and plead for their <hi>Debaucheries.</hi> No wonder then (if they can thus pervert the Dictates of the Divine <hi>Spirit</hi>) that they ſhould catch at all opportunities of making even thoſe diſcourſes which are deſigned againſt them, to ſpeak, at leaſt implicitely, in their behalf. But <hi>Good God!</hi> To what a head will theſe Enormities grow? And how neceſſarily muſt the Contagion ſtill prevail, ſince the wholeſomeſt of Medicines are converted by the Infected into Poyſon? Some ſmart Satyr, one would think, might do a little good, ſuch a one as might laſh the Wretch ſtark naked, and put him upon the Rack in the midſt of his Impurities: but alaſs! we find <hi>God</hi>'s Judgments themſelves (tho' frequently ſent down upon the Incorrigible, yet)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150001:44"/> lightly eſteemed by the hardened World, who make a mock of the Puniſhment as well as the Crime. I ſhall therefore take what care I can, not to make the debauched Worſe, and with all Prudence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage my diſcourſe on this nice point, ſo as I may not in the leaſt give Encouragement to the Sin, which I am ſo willing to decry. I hope at leaſt it may prove a Caution and a Sea-mark to the Unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Soul, to keep <hi>it</hi> from being polluted and ruined with the reſt; and if it accidentally prove a means of <hi>Reforming</hi> one debauched Perſon from the Error of his Ways, I ſhall think my labour well beſtow'd.</p>

A Looſe, Libertine, and Licentious Converſation, does eaſily incline a man to Joyn with the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in one Common way of Lewdneſs and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery: Familiarity and Example, Fear and Shame, private Obligations and publick Engagements are as great Inducements to depraved Nature to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with thoſe to whom one ſtands Obliged in any of the former Reſpects.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to intimate as much, and declares this Honourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute was appointed to avoid Fornication. Not is it enough to forbear all unlawful and forbidden Embraces, nor even to abſtain from what is Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as well as Morally, Evil; but Even our allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and warrantable Enjoyments muſt (like Phyſick) be taken moderately and with caution, leſt our Remedy prove our Poyſon. He that thinks becauſe he is in lawful Circumſtances, he may give his Luſts their full Swing, deceives himſelf; for that in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage a Man may be guilty of Senſuality is paſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. 'Tis unqueſtionably true, that whoever tranſgreſſeth the Principal end of Marriage, <hi>viz.</hi> of Glorifying <hi>God,</hi> and ſubſervient thereto thoſe of Propagating our kind, of maintaining Mutual Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and avoiding of Unlawful Luſts, has paſſed the boundaries of Nature, Reaſon and Religion all at once.</p>
                  <p>In the entring upon ſuch a Sacred Rite, there are many things to be obſerved, and ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, both by the betrothed Parties and their Friends, in order to have the Marriage ſucceſsfull and made in Heaven firſt, before the ſtriking, of Hands, and the Plighting of Troths here on Earth: and for want of the due Conſideration whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes ſo many Unhappy Matches, Family Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, and Civil Broils; ſo frequent Separations
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150001:61"/> from, and Pollutions of the Conjugal Bed, which every day happen afreſh in the World. I ſhall but juſt touch upon theſe Neceſſary Precautions, and ſo conclude this particular of Uncleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>As for you who have Adult Children of your own, or elſe are Guardians to ſuch; Beware of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring them from entring into the ſtate of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, when either their Years, their Inclinations, their Affections, and their other Circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame: Conſult your Pupils in all reſpects, and be not (more than prudently) urgent in diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them from their own, or in perſwading them into an Approbation of your Choice: In diſpoſing of them, have an Eye more upon their Temporal Happineſs, and their Eternal Good, than upon the Flattering Proſpect of their being Noble, Rich, or Great: Covet not to Marry your Sons or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or any other Relations committed to your Truſt, into Families of a Higher Rank than your ſelves, and deſpiſe not to Match them with thoſe of a Degree lower than you, eſpecially where the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Generoſity of the perſon can toſs your lighter Scale of Birth and Fortune up to the Beam.</p>
                  <p>As for the Young parties, I deſire they would not take ill the following Advice, before they put on the Wedding Suit, which will not coſt them ſo much, and perhaps do them more Service. Be ſure then to avoid all Haſty, ſudden, and Unpremeditated fits of Paſſion: Love not for Luſts ſake, and Idolize none for their Beauty, Wit, Strength and Fortune, leſt your Affection be no more than Skin-deep; call in Wiſer Heads to adviſe in ſo Weighty a Cauſe, and if your Modeſty or any other reaſon will not admit you to ask your Friends advice therein, yet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150001:62"/> be pleaſed to think God worthy to be of your Council: In a word let no Object Charm you but what has the Lineaments of Virtue, and the Endowments of a Noble Mind, which with, or without the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Qualifications, are of force only to Captivate our Souls. Hence it is that we perceive the Love, grounded upon theſe External Objects only, to be ſhort-liv'd and Tranſient, ſoon Hot, and ſoon Cold; laſting no longer than the Object appears to be Beautiful, Strong, Witty and Wealthy, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nauſeous when Impotency, Wither'd Age, or Poverty over-takes them, and often before: whilſt the more ſubſtantial Love, founded upon and raiſed by the inward Ornament of the Mind, gives Life to the Love of outward, and maintains its own Flame within, when all the Fuel adminiſtred from without is taken away. This Noble Intellectual Love Unites and Conſolidates the Parties tho' in Rags and Poverty, tho' in Gray-Hairs and Wrinkles, and breaths after a Union beyond this and the Grave. This is that Love, we ſhould be all inflamed with, and deſire to Contract with each other, not becauſe we have Painted Faces, and a handſomer piece of Clay for our Share than others are Moulded into, or becauſe we have more of Giddy Fortunes Favours; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe inward Ornaments of Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, of Sobriety and Temperance, of Modeſty and Humility, of Chaſtity and Charity, of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Affability, which ſet off the ſubject in which they are inherent with ſuch invincible and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Charms, as no being above a Brute can forbear to be inamoured with.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:150001:74"/> firſt ſtep thereunto. It is by our Abſence from Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duties in <hi>Publick</hi> that we come to leave off thoſe in <hi>Private</hi> too; that we loſe our true Notions of the <hi>Godhead;</hi> that we have but Glimmering Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Joys and Torments of another World, being taken up only with ſuch as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and affect our <hi>Sence;</hi> that we think all the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> of an Holy Life to be but <hi>Sham</hi> and <hi>Invention;</hi> that we eſteem <hi>Vices</hi> Natural, and to have nothing condemnable in them; that our <hi>Hearts</hi> become har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and our <hi>Conſciences</hi> ſeared, our <hi>Reaſon</hi> blinded, our <hi>

Nor is it ſtrange the <hi>Man</hi> ſhould not be able to withſtand the Torrent of Vice, when with his own hand he opens the <hi>Sluce,</hi> and lets the Impetuous ſtream break in upon him.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>The next Benefit of Sanctifying the Lords-Day is that it weans us from the eager purſuit of Worldly Things;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A ſecond Benefit is the weaning us from this World.</note> This ſolemn Sequeſtration of our thoughts from <hi>Earthly,</hi> carries them out to <hi>Heavenly</hi> ſubjects: and by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Joys and Glories of <hi>another</hi> World we loſe our Veneration and Eſteem for <hi>this;</hi> and by being raiſed above this Worlds Enjoyments we have
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:150001:75"/> an opportunity of ſeeing what a <hi>Point</hi> it is we are too apt to doat on, and what mighty Nothings they are which ſo often captivate our Souls and lead them on to their own Deſtruction. By Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating of the Crowns and Diadems of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we moderate our Deſires as to the Conveniences as well as pleaſures of this Life: By Meditating on the Eternity which is juſt ready to Succeed, we are informed of the Inconſtancy and Swiftneſs of this Moment, this Span of time we <hi>New</hi> enjoy. By Contemplating the Durableneſs of all Caeleſtial Fruitions we come to know that this World vaniſheth away, and the Faſhion thereof is every day upon its Alteration. By Conſidering the Immortality of our better Parts we are inſtructed how Frail, Mortal, and Short-liv'd our Earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles are. To conclude, by being Fixed and Spiritualized, by conceiving right Notions of <hi>God,</hi> and ſurveying the Charms and Endearments of thoſe Manſions prepared for us above, we arrive to that height of Admiration, Love, and Eſteem, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things but <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>Droſs</hi> that we may gain <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to breath earneſtly to be diſſolved, that we may be ſettled there, where true Joys are to be found.</p>

But notwithſtanding they have <hi>Statutes</hi> made to their very hands, and have had as much Incitements from <hi>Above,</hi> as Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and a Royal Command comes to, yet we find matters at the ſame ſtand they were in, when we had no ſuch Opportunities put into our Hands. To think any <hi>Juſtice of Peace</hi> ignorant of his Duty, would be to charge him with want of Common Prudence, an affront I would not lay at any Mans Door: But I am more inclined to think that 'tis want of <hi>Zeal</hi> which makes ſo many remiſs and negligent in the Diſcharge of that Truſt, which the <hi>Higher Power</hi> has Committed to them. To ſuch therefore as are Backward in their Offfice I ſhall beg leave to offer ſome few Conſiderations, which perhaps may prove Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to ſtir them up to a Vigorous Execution of the Laws now in force againſt that horrid <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> which has overſpread this unhappy <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt conſider what 'tis God and Religion requires at your Hands.</hi> He that raiſeth up whom he will, and caſteth them down again at his pleaſure, has not placed you in thoſe Poſts to make a great Figure of you, and for nothing elſe. He requires you ſhould be as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Advancing of his Glory, as you
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:150001:83"/> are for your own private Intereſts. 'Tis as much your Duty to puniſh an Offence againſt God, as to puniſh a Crime againſt the Publick, and yet we ſee the one Connived at, whilſt the other is proſecuted with the utmoſt R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gor. But is it not a burning ſhame that the daily Affronts and Blaſphemies offered againſt Heaven ſhould be paſſed by with ſilence, when at the ſame time a Leſſening Expreſſion againſt a Prince, a ſingle Calumny againſt your ſelves, or a Scurrilous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection caſt upon a Private Perſon ſhall meet with all the Severity the Law in its Largeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will allow of?</p>
            <p>But Secondly, <hi>Conſider what 'tis you owe your Princes from whence you derive your Authority.</hi> The Commiſſion they have given you extends to the offences mentioned in the foregoing Treatiſe, as well as to any other whatſoever. And as if that were not ſufficient, how car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ful have they been by Letters and Proclamations to put you in mind of your Duty in this Particular. And can you Affront their Authority by ſlighting and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Orders and Injunctions? Think what a baſe reflection you caſt upon them, and how uncivil (to ſay no worſe) you have been by your Connivance and Neglect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider what 'tis your Country requires of you.</hi> She expects you ſhould not ſtand as Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, nor bear the Sword of Juſtice in Vain, but that you ſhould adminiſter it to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Wickedneſs and Vice, and to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of true Religion and Virtue. Thoſe who among the Romans Reſcued the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth from Tyranny and Oppreſſion were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:150001:84"/> juſtly ſtiled <hi>Fathers of their Country;</hi> our Kingdom is at preſent overawed with the Tyranny of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs and Debauchery, and none but God knows what the fatal conſequences of it may prove; Now if you would (Gentlemen) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake an Enterprize worthy Engliſh Men and Chriſtians, if you deſire the Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of your Country, and would do ſomething that might render your Memories famous to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations, you can do nothing better than in your ſeveral Stations to Redeem the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Thraldom of thoſe Pernicious Vices under which it lies, and ſo Divert thoſe Judgements we have juſt cauſe to fear will fall upon us, if we continue Obſtinate and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lastly,</hi> (that it may not be too long) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what 'tis your Oaths taken with all the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Imaginable oblige you to.</hi> I ſhall not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat at length all that a <hi>Juſtice of Peace</hi> is bound to do; it may ſuffice to take notice that he is engaged to Convict all Offenders againſt the known Statutes of the Realm, of which he ſhall have any Cognizance: and not to refuſe upon Due and Lawful Information to bring any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to Condign Puniſhment out of <hi>Fear, Partiality, Prejudice</hi> or <hi>Intereſt.</hi> I hope there is ſcarce a Gentleman in the Commiſſion of the Peace but will lay theſe things to heart; and will not, when he Conſiders ſeriouſly what it is, that <hi>God, their Majeſties, his Country,</hi> and <hi>his own Conſcience</hi> exacts from him, be any more negligent in the Diſcharge of that Truſt which is repoſed in him.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:150001:84"/>
            <p>I have been warm in this point, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as ſhort and as modeſt as poſſible: I hope the Gentlemen will pardon the little ſallies of a well grounded and well-intended Zeal; ſince my Deſign was not to affront any, but purely to excite thoſe who have been hitherto Remiſs to be more vigorous in Executing the Laws againſt Prophaneſs and Debauchery for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that not one Tittle of this Diſcourſe is directed to ſuch Worthy Perſons who (tho too few in number) are in the Commiſſion of the Peace all over the Kingdom, and have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſufficient Teſtimony of their <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> by thoſe excellent <hi>Orders of Seſſions</hi> which here and there have been iſſued out in thoſe Places, where the Good have been the Prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how can the Juſtices of Peace ſuppreſs thoſe Immoralities, ſince let them be never ſo forward, 'tis impoſſible for them to know of every offence unleſs the under Officers, whoſe Duty it is to make enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Breach of the Laws, give in their Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; And that tho they may iſſue out their Warrants, yet if the Conſtable, or Overſeer, or any other Officer be negligent in executing them, what will their Care ſignifie?</hi> To which I anſwer, that 'tis too noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious how Careleſs and Remiſs all <hi>under Officers</hi> are as well in giving in their Informations, as in executing the Warrants and Levying the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties accordingly; and 'tis no wonder they ſhould be ſo, ſince they are like to get nothing by their Office, but hard Words and a few Curſes, which is but a ſmall Encouragement to thoſe little hearted Creatures, who for the moſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:150001:85"/> part know not what the Pleaſure or Profit of a Good Conſcience reſulting from an Honeſt diſcharge of Duty means. However this their Neglect excuſes not the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon his Conduct, who will not, when 'tis in his Power, make thoſe Inſtruments of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice more Careful and Diligent in their Reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Offices. For there are Laws whereby he may correct their Negligence, as well as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crime whatſoever.</p>
            <p>That theſe <hi>Inferiour Officers</hi> may not pretend Ignorance, I have hereunto ſubjoyned an <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of thoſe <hi>Statutes</hi> which are now in force againſt the daring Wickedneſs of theſe times; which may not only be of ſome uſe to them to inform them of part of their Duty, but alſo may be ſerviceable to others who either have not mony enough to buy, or not time enough to run over the Voluminous <hi>Statute Book.</hi> I have likewiſe added the <hi>Queens Letter to the Juſtices of Middleſex,</hi> their <hi>Order</hi> thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their <hi>Majeſties Proclamation</hi> ſince, to ſhew what Encouragement we have from them to ſet about a <hi>Speedy Reformation.</hi>
